<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<P>Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

<PRE>voidfractionModel divided;
dividedProps
{
    alphaMin number1;
    interpolation;
    weight number2;
    porosity number3;
} 
</PRE>
<UL><LI><I>number1</I> = minimum limit for voidfraction 

<LI><I>interpolation</I> = flag to interpolate voidfraction to particle positions (normally off) 

<LI><I>number2</I> = (optional) scaling of the particle volume to account for porosity or agglomerations. 

<LI><I>number3</I> = (optional) diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased according to <I>number2</I> * Vparticle, volume remains unaltered!

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The divided voidFraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or its representation) is in the size range of a CFD cell. Satellite points are used to divide the particle's volume to the touched cells.
</P>
<P>The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by "porosity", which  blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for voidfraction calculation) constant.
</P>
<P>The particle volume occupied in the CFD domain can be adjusted by the parameter "weight", using Vparticle=dsphere^3*pi/6*weight.
</P>
<P>In the basic implementation of solvers, the void fraction is calculated based on all particles. Depending on the solver used, the void fraction calculation is also performed for a certain type of particles.
The void fraction calculation is based on a three-step approach (reset, set and interpolate), i.e., the void fraction is time interpolated from a previous and a next void fraction field. Appropriate names for these fields have to be specified in the sub-dictionaries voidFracFieldNamesPrev and voidFracFieldNamesNext in the couplingProperties dictionary.
