<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The ShirgaonkarIB model calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each particle in a resolved manner (see Shirgaonkar et al. (2009): "A new mathematical formulation and fast algorithm for fully resolved simulation of self-propulsion", Journal of Comp. Physics). This model is only suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where the particle is represented by immersed boundary method.
