forceModel_LaEuScalarTemp command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    LaEuScalarTemp
);
LaEuScalarTempProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    tempFieldName "T";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfraction";
    partTempName "Temp";
    partHeatFluxName "convectiveHeatFlux";
    lambda value;
    Cp value1;
    interpolation "switch1";
    verbose "switch2";
\}; :pre

{U} = name of the finite volume fluid velocity field :ulb,l
{T} = name of the finite volume scalar temperature field :l
{voidfraction} = name of the finite volume voidfraction field :l
{Temp} = name of the DEM data representing the particles temperature :l
{convectiveHeatFlux} = name of the DEM data representing the particle-fluid convective heat flux :l
{value} = fluid thermal conductivity \[W/(m*K)\] :l
{value1} = fluid specific heat capacity \[W*s/(kg*K)\] :l
{switch1} = (optional, normally off) flag to use interpolated voidfraction and fluid velocity values :l
{switch2} = (normally off) for verbose run :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    LaEuScalarTemp
);
LaEuScalarTempProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    tempFieldName "T";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfraction";
    partTempName "Temp";
    partHeatFluxName "convectiveHeatFlux";
    lambda 0.0256;
    Cp 1007;
\} :pre

[Description:]

This "forceModel" does not influence the particles or the fluid flow! Using the particles' temperature a scalar field representing "particle-fluid heatflux" is calculated. The solver then uses this source field in the scalar transport equation for the temperature. The model for convective heat transfer is based on Li and Mason (2000), A computational investigation of transient heat transfer in  pneumatic transport of granular particles, Pow.Tech 112

[Restrictions:]

Goes only with cfdemSolverScalar. The force model has to be the second (!!!) model in the forces list.
