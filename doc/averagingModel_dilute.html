<H3>averagingModel_dilute command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<P>Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The averaging model performs the Lagrangian->Eulerian mapping of data (e.g. particle velocities).
In the "cfdemParticle cloud" this averaging model is used to calculate the average particle velocity inside a CFD cell. The "dilute" model is supposed to be applied to cases where the granular regime is rather dilute. The particle velocity inside a CFD cell is evaluated from a single particle in a cell (no averaging).
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This model is computationally efficient, but should only be used when only one particle is inside one CFD cell.
