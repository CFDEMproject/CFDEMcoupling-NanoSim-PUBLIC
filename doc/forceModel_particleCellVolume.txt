forceModel_particleCellVolume command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    particleCellVolume
);
particleCellVolumeProps
\{
    upperThreshold value;
    lowerThreshold value2;
    verbose;
\}; :pre

{value} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) lower than this upper threshold are considered :l
{value2} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) greater than this lower threshold are considered :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    particleCellVolume
);
particleCellVolumeProps
\{
    upperThreshold 0.999;
    lowerThreshold 0;
    verbose;
\} :pre

[Description:]

This "forceModel" does not influence the particles or the simulation - it is a postprocessing tool! The total volume of the particles as they are represented on the CFD mesh is calculated. Further the total volume of the cells particles are in is calculated.
At "writeTime" a field named particleCellVolume , where scalarField is the name of the original field, is written. This can then be probed using standard function object probes. Analogously a field named cellVolume is written. Using the verbose option a screen output is given.

[Restrictions:]

None.
