liggghtsCommandModel_execute command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in liggghtsCommmands dictionary.

liggghtsCommandModels
(
   execute
);
executeProps0
\{
    command
    (
        run
        $couplingInterval
    );
    runFirst switch1; 
    runLast switch2;
    runEveryCouplingStep switch3;
    runEveryWriteStep switch4;
    verbose;
\} :pre

{command} = LIGGGHTS command to be executed. Each word in a new line, numbers and symbols need special treatment (e.g. $couplingInterval will be replaced by correct coupling interval in the simulation)  :ulb,l
{switch1} = switch (choose on/off) if the command is executed only at first time step :l
{switch2} = switch (choose on/off) if the command is executed only at last time step :l
{switch3} = switch (choose on/off) if the command is executed at every coupling step :l
{switch4} = switch (choose on/off) if the command is executed at every writing step :l
{verbose} = (normally off) for verbose run :l
:ule

[Examples:]

liggghtsCommandModels
(
   execute
   execute
);
executeProps0
\{
    command
    (
        run
        $couplingInterval
    );
    runFirst off;
    runLast off;
    runEveryCouplingStep on;
\}
executeProps1
\{
    command
    (
        write_restart
        noBlanks
        dotdot
        slash
        DEM
        slash
        liggghts.restart_
        timeStamp
    );
    runFirst off;
    runLast off;
    runEveryCouplingStep off;
    runEveryWriteStep on;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The execute liggghtsCommand Model can be used to execute a LIGGGHTS command during a CFD run. In above example execute_0 for instance executes "run $couplingInterval" every coupling step. $couplingInterval is automatically replaced by the correct number of DEM steps. Additionally execute_1 executes "write_restart ../DEM/liggghts.restart_$timeStamp" every writing step, where $timeStamp is automatically set.

These rather complex execute commands can be replaced by the "readLiggghts" and "writeLiggghts" commands! :h4

[Restrictions:] None.
