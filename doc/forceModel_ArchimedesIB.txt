forceModel_ArchimedesIB command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    ArchimedesIB
);
ArchimedesIBProps
\{
    gravityFieldName "gravity";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfraction";
\}; :pre

{gravity} = name of the finite volume gravity field :ulb,l
{voidfraction} = name of the finite volume voidfraction field :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    ArchimedesIB
);
ArchimedesIBProps
\{
    gravityFieldName "g";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfractionNext";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The ArchimedesIB model is a model that calculates the ArchimedesIB' volumetric lift force stemming from density difference of fluid and particle. This model is especially suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where the particle is represented by immersed boundary method.

[Restrictions:]

Only for immersed boundary solvers.
