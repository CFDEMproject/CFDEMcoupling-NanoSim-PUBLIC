<UL><LI><I>particleIDsToSample</I> = list of particle IDs to be sampled. 

<LI><I>myForceModeli</I> = list of force models in the simulation, the particleProbe will be applied to all of these models! 

<LI><I>verboseToFile</I> = main switch to activate the particle probe (default = off). 

<LI><I>verbose</I> = main switch to activate output to Info (currently not implemented). 

<LI><I>xEvery</I> = integer to specify the interval for sampling (default = 1, i.e., probing occurs every CFD time step). 

<LI><I>sampleAll</I> = switch to activate sampling of all particles. Otherwise (default) only particles specified via "particleIDsToSample" in the couplingProperties dictionary will be sampled. 

<LI><I>probeDebug</I> = switch to activate probing of debug properties of secondary importance (specific for each force model). 

<LI><I>includePosition</I> = switch to add the particle position in the log file (default = off). 

<LI><I>xPrecision</I>= number of significant digits of the text output (default = 3).

<P>Note: This examples list might not be complete - please check below for the list of force models that can perform particle probing.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The particleProbe feature keeps track of per-particle quantities (e.g., the fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle, and handles its storage during the simulation. Data is saved in the CFD/particleProbes/startTime directory, where startTime is the time at which the simulation is started (this avoids unwanted deletion of particleProbe data).
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>You can manually switch off the probe model for each force model by specifying the Switch "suppressProbe" in the corresponding force properties dictionary.
