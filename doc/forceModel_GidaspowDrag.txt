forceModel_GidaspowDrag command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    GidaspowDrag
);
GidaspowDragProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfraction";
    granVelFieldName "Us";
    phi "scalar";
    interpolation switch1;
    implForceDEM switch2;
\}; :pre

{U} = name of the finite volume fluid velocity field :ulb,l
{voidfraction} = name of the finite volume voidfraction field :l
{Us} = name of the finite volume cell averaged particle velocity field :l
{phi} = drag correction factor (in doubt 1) :l
{switch1} = (optional, normally off) flag to use interpolated voidfraction and fluid velocity values :l
{switch2} = (optional, normally off) flag to use implicit formulation of drag on DEM side:l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    GidaspowDrag
);
GidaspowDragProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    voidfractionFieldName "voidfraction";
    granVelFieldName "Us";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The GidaspowDrag model is a model that calculates the particle based drag force following the correlation of Gidaspow which is a combination of Ergun (1952) and Wen & Yu (1966)  (see Zhu et al. (2007): "Discrete particle simulation of particulate systems: Theoretical developments", ChemEngScience).

[Restrictions:]

none.
